            title: Introduction
            content: >
                <p>The Koalati API allows you to integrate the website testing features you know and love in your favorite tools and platforms.</p>
                <p>The API is built on REST principles, and can be used with both the managed and the self-hosted versions of Koalati.</p>
        url:
            title: API URL
            content: >
                <p>
                    The Koalati API for the managed version of Koalati is available at the following URL:<br>
                    <code>https://app.koalati.com/api/</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For self-hosted instances of Koalati in which the API is available (v1.1.0 and above), you can access the API at
                    the <code>/api/</code> of your instance's hostname.
                </p>
        formats:
            title: Formats
            content: >
                <p>The following formats can be used to interact with the API:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JSON-LD (<code>application/ld+json</code>) - default</li>
                    <li>JSON (<code>application/json</code>)</li>
                    <li>JSON HAL (<code>application/hal+json</code>)</li>
                    <li>JSON:API (<code>application/vnd.api+json</code>)</li>
                    <li>XML (<code>application/xml</code> or <code>text/xml</code>)</li>
                    <li>YAML (<code>application/x-yaml</code>)</li>
                    <li>CSV (<code>text/csv</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>However, please note that authentication calls must use the
                    JSON (<code>application/json</code>) format.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can specify the desired response format by using the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept" target="_blank"><code>Accept</code> HTTP header</a>. Ex.: <code>Accept: application/ld+json</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The payload type may be defined using the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type" target="_blank">Content-Type HTTP header</a>.
                    Ex.: <code>Content-Type: application/ld+json</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This documentation provides payload samples for the most popular and recommended formats.
                    Here are a few examples of the other supported formats:
                </p>
                <p><strong>XML:</strong></p>
                <pre><code><!--

        rate_limiting:
            title: Rate Limiting
            content: >
                <p>To ensure our platform remains stable and that API usage remains aligned with the core purpose of Koalati, the API is rate-limited.</p>
                <p>We ask developers to use industry standard techniques to limit calls, cache results, and retry requests responsibly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Limit for authentication endpoints: <strong>60 calls per hour</strong><br>
                        <small>(fixed window strategy: resets once per hour)</small>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Limit for all other endpoints: <strong>60 calls per minute</strong> <br>
                        <small>(bucket strategy: one token restored per second)</small>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every API response contains headers to help you prevent excessive usage
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>x-ratelimit-limit</code></li>
                        <li><code>x-ratelimit-remaining</code></li>
                        <li><code>x-ratelimit-retry-after</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
        pagination:
            title: Pagination
            content: >
                <p>Koalati provides API endpoints to retrieve lists of resources.</p>
                <p>Most of these lists are paginated, displaying <code>50</code> items per page by default</p>
                <h3>Changing the number of items per page</h3>
                <p>You can change the number of items per page by passing the <code>itemsPerPage</code> query parameter in your API calls (maximum of <code>100</code>).</p>
                <h3>Disabling the pagination</h3>
                <p>You can disable the pagination by passing the <code>pagination</code> query parameter in your API calls with a value of <code>false</code>.</p>
        http_methods:
            title: HTTP Methods
            content: >
                <p>Koalati's API uses the standard HTTP verbs, as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>GET</code>:
                        Used for retrieving resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>POST</code>:
                        Used for creating resources and performing resource actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>PUT</code>:
                        Used for updating resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>PATCH</code>:
                        Used for partially updating resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>DELETE</code>:
                        Used for deleting resources.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        http_codes:
            title: HTTP Status Codes
            content: >
                <p>Koalati's API responds with standard HTTP status codes.</p>
                <p>Here are the status codes you are likely to encounter when using the Koalati API:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>200</code>: OK</li>
                    <li><code>201</code>: Created</li>
                    <li><code>202</code>: Accepted</li>
                    <li><code>204</code>: No Content (Resource has been deleted)</li>
                    <li><code>400</code>: Bad Request</li>
                    <li><code>401</code>: Unauthorized (Missing Authorization token)</li>
                    <li><code>403</code>: Forbidden (User does not have access to the requested action or resource)</li>
                    <li><code>404</code>: URL Not Found</li>
                    <li><code>405</code>: Method Not Allowed</li>
                    <li><code>429</code>: Rate Limit Exceeded (API usage limit exceeded)</li>
                    <li><code>500</code>: Internal Error</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more information about HTTP codes, please refer to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">MDN's documentation</a>.</p>
        authentication:
            title: Authentication
            content: >
                <p>To access Koalati's API, you have to authenticate with a valid Koalati user account.</p>
                <p>
                    This is done by generating an authentication token (in the form of a JWT) and providing it as a
                    <a href="https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/" target="_blank">Bearer Token</a> in all of your API calls.
                </p>
                <p>There are two ways to generate an authentication token for the Koalati API:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Generate the authentication token within the Koalati application itself.</strong><br>
                        To do so, go to <i/Settings > Security > API access</i>, and find the <i>Authentication Token</i> section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Call the <code>/api/auth</code> API endpoint with the desired user's login credentials.</strong><br>
                        You should only do this once to get the initial token; you should never store your login credentials
                        on a server or provide them to a third party application.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every authentication token you generate has an expiration date, after which it becomes invalid. However,
                    you may refresh a authentication token by providing the API the refresh token that was issued at the same
                    time as your JWT. Check out the <code>/api/token/refresh</code> endpoint below to learn how to do this.
                </p>

        <h2>Before you get started...</h2>
        <p>Testing websites with Koalati comes in two stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Manual testing</strong>: follow our checklist to test your site manually.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated testing</strong>: follow our automated recommendations to further optimize your site.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We highly recommend you test your site in this order because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Manual testing is very important, as most issues can't be detected automatically.</li>
            <li>Automated recommendations can take a bit of time to generate. But as you work you way through the checklist, our system will start generating them automatically in the background.</li>
        </ol>
